# TinyHttp ver 0.2
## A socket programming proj by @wstnl
*notice: The author(maybe you could call me @youzi) is a very primary programmer and still in the progress of study, so if you find any bug in the program, feel free to create an issue!*
### Info
In the ver0.2, I tried `epoll` instead of `poll` to deal with I/O multiplexing. 
To run the project, simply clone it and use the command `make`, and then `./httpd` to run the server.
Use your browser to visit `localhost:23333`, the home page will show up.
